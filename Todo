Assembler:

Minor features/work (do it):

 - need local labels in macros
 - need convenient block local labels

    branch labels:

	@:	foo
		bar
		fred
		bne	@

 - integers should be larger than word size (at least 64 bits).

 - fill pattern for .align and .space.  this is complicated.

 - early or late evaluation for .foreach?  We would like it to be early
   evaluation for this- not late (then we could pass it string variables). 
   But that implies it's not the same as a macro.  Maybe expression
   evaluation/simplification should return a string result?

Optional/future:

 - add .showrules.

 - need to make pager (as seperate program).

 - limit object module record size?

 - listing
   - more information in data area of each line:
      - section name
      - fixup info

 - verify/improve memory management.

 - compress source references in object file.  right now they are huge.
   perhaps there should be a file names list section and we use some sort of
   format for this.  don't know what to do about .errif messages though.

Verifications:

 - check for circular reference bugs.

 - macro recursion depth limit?
